# VS Code Snippets
This repository contains a collection of snippets for Visual Studio Code. They are not many for now, but I'll upload more as I need them â€” meanwhile, you're encouraged to contribute!

## Using the snippets
To use the snippets, either copy-paste from this repo to your User Snippets or, to access *all* of the snippets from this repo, clone it in:
- `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\(language).json` on Windows
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/(language).json` on macOS
- `$HOME/.config/Code/User/snippets/(language).json` on Linux

Please note that **this will delete all of your current snippets** (potentially just some, or even none, but it will make a mess anyway), so if you have some pre-existing snippets, I strongly recommend you either:
- just paste in those that you need
- share your current snippets and *then* clone the repo
