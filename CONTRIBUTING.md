# Contributing to this repo

> Thank you for your time and interest!

## Guidelines
Because I would like to avoid an unnecessarily verbose CONTRIBUTING.md file, I'll rather sum it up in a few points below. In no particular order,
- **don't insult or harass** others in any way, no matter how similar or different they are to you;
- PRs must **use gitmoji** (I'd recommend your commits do as well, but it's not required);
- to upload a new snippet, you can just **create a PR**;
  - if you are thinking of creating a snippet from scratch (i.e. just for the community, not copied from your User Snippets), first thank you for your efforts, then maybe **consider creating an issue** to discuss your snippet, in order to avoid you working pointlessly;
  - in case you would like to have a new snippet, but for whatever reason don't feel like writing it (it happens ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), create an issue;
- all snippets' prefix must be between 3 and 5 characters.

### Resolving snippet prefix conflicts
If you'd like to share a snippet whose (reasonably chosen) prefix is the same as the one of another snippet for the same language, please create a PR anyways ‚Äî one prefix will be changed, but which one will have to be decided.
